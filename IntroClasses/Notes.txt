Classes -> blueprints/building blocks of objects. A map or model of the "real" thing (though more abstract in computing than in the physical world...)
The classes - as for objects in the real/physical world - need to have properties (descriptive elements)!!

Public/private access modes;
Public - anyone has access
Private - only access within the same class (self-contained)

Constructor - piece of code that sets the values of the instance variables (this.<var-name>) to what we pass as arguments in the constructor :)
